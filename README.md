# Lexical-Analyzer
This Java program is a lightweight lexical analyzer for C++ code. It reads code from a file (which users can customize) and categorizes tokens into keywords, identifiers, operators, symbols, and constants. The summary of token counts and unique values in each category is displayed at the end.
